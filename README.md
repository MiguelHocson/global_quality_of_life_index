# Data Project: Global Quality of Life Index

# Overview

I chose this project as my second project due to my passion for travel and plans to relocate in the future. The dashboard aims to help travelers, expats, institutions, and organizations analyze and assess quality of life across countries. The project involves data exploration, cleaning, transformation, and manipulation using Power Query in Excel, along with data visualization in Power BI. Sourced from Kaggle, the dataset includes quality-of-life metrics such as purchasing power, safety, healthcare, cost of living, traffic, pollution, and overall quality of life, offering both numerical scores and descriptive categories for a comprehensive analysis.

# Objective

To analyze global quality of life trends and disparities, offering insights for policymakers and researchers to guide development and resource allocation. The analysis will also help travelers and expats make informed decisions on relocation and travel, highlighting factors like safety, healthcare, and cost of living.


# Data Source

The [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/quality-of-life-for-each-country) is sourced from Kaggle (an Excel extract). The dataset consists of columns such as but not limited to:

| Column_Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| country | Name of the country. |
| Purchasing Power Value | Numeric score for purchasing power |
| Purchasing Power Category | Qualitative category for purchasing power |
| Quality of Life Value | Numeric score for overall quality of life |
| Quality of Life Category | Qualitative quality of life category. | 
| Cost of Living Value | Numeric score for cost of living |
| Cost of Living Category | Qualitative cost of living category |
| Safety Value |  Numeric safety index score |
| Safety Category | Qualitative safety category |

## Design Considerations

- Below are the design considerations and key questions that guided the creation of the initial visualization:

•	How can we effectively display key quality-of-life metrics for different countries at a glance?
•	What visualizations best highlight the top and bottom-ranked countries in each category?
•	How can we visualize the relationships between multiple quality-of-life factors (e.g., cost of living, safety, healthcare) across countries?

## Dashboard Mockups
